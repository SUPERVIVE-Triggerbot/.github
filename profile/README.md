# SUPERVIVE Triggerbot – Pull the Trigger Without Thinking 😎🔫

## Let the Cheat Do the Shooting 🔥

You already know **SUPERVIVE** gets sweaty fast—snap aim, tight angles, and quick peeks. But sometimes, even if your aim's on point, **reaction time can sell you out**. That’s where the **SUPERVIVE Triggerbot** changes the whole game.

This cheat **automatically fires your weapon the second your crosshair touches an enemy**, giving you literal millisecond reaction times. Combine that with aimbot or ESP? You’re a one-man death squad. 💣💀

## 🎮 What is the SUPERVIVE Triggerbot?

The **triggerbot** is a lightweight external cheat that hooks into your game and monitors your crosshair in real time. When it detects an enemy **within your aim zone**, it **instantly fires for you**—no mouse click needed.

It’s perfect for **snipers**, **quick peekers**, or just anyone who wants crisp kills without trying too hard. Want to look legit? Tweak the settings for human-like reaction timing. Want to go rage mode? Set that delay to 0 and full-send it. 😈
